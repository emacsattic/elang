* Critical

   - top-level code evaluation (as an anonymous function)

   - the for loop

   - is vs == vs =

   - text on is vs == vs =

   - text dynamic binding and lexical binding in Elang

   - text on proper examples (strings, expressions, globals, while, if/elif/else)

* Secondary

   - docstrings

   - interactive emacs function

   - optional function args

   - list syntax

   - multiple value assignments, mutiple value return, etc

   - remove to-plain-list-if-single in testlist
