* Critical

  Important features missing:

   1. The for loop.

      Both very important and missing.

   2. is vs == vs =

      How to map eq/equal/eql should be mapped into the language?

   3. Top-level code evaluation.

      Upon buffer evaluation currently only simple top-level assignment values
      are set. Proper expressions should work too!

   4. Interactive emacs functions.

      Although probably not fully doable within the syntax, there should at
      least be a way to declare such a function.

   5. Lisp symbols.

      Symbols are really important for Lisp interop.

* Secondary

  Features that would help a lot:

   1. Docstrings.

   2. Optional function args.

   3. List syntax

   4. Hash syntax.

   5. Multiple value assignments, mutiple value return, etc.

   6. Remove to-plain-list-if-single in testlist.
